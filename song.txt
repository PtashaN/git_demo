Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and blue seas
Back in her arms he swear he'll be
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day


They marched him to the station house
He waited for the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged

"You stand accused of robbery"
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom
